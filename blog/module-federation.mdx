In this blog we'll look into different ways to achieve micro-frontend pattern and where does module federation stand in this space
and we'll also see how to expose a component from one react app and make it available in another react app using webpack's
module federation. If you direcly want to see the implementation <a href="#example">click here</a>.

Micro frontends, are similar to how [micro services](https://microservices.io/) are for backend development. Micro services are isolations of
different functionalities in backend, so that each service can have their own build and deployment process. So micro-frontend
is essetially that but for front end development. But micro front ends are not exactly similar to micro services.
In micro services, we split up the functionality and they run seperately but in micro-frontends, eventhough we seperate the
functionality, it is required to run on a common base and served as a single unit.

## Integration approaches

Before module federation there are various existing patterns that can be used to achieve micro frontend architecture. All
these patterns have their own sets of merits and demerits. Based on its integration type (i.e how they are used in the
target frontend code), they come under two main classification,

- Build-time intergration
- Run-time integration

#### Build-time integration

The micro frontends are added to the target on a build time basis. They are configured in the build tool of the target repo.
One common example is publishing micro-frontends through package managers like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

In build-time integration, you have to maintain a build and deployment process for each micro frontend , but the overall
app performance is better in build-time integrations since there is no seperate wait times, as they are loaded during
the targets build time itself.

#### Runtime Integration

In this type of integration, the micro frontends are injected and loaded during the run-time of
the target code base. [Iframes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.ASP) and modules from cdn through script tags are
example of run-time integration.

In run-time integration you don't have to publish and maintain versions for your micro front-ends. Therefore, you don't have
to build, publish and install the micro frontends in the target code, even if there is a small change. The main problem with
run time intergation is that they are added only during the run time, therefore we should write code considering its load time
and if its not properly handled it will severly affect the app's performance.

## Module federation

[Module federation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/) was introduced to overcome the above disadvantages in the micro-frontend
space. It can be itegrated during build time but you don't have to maintain versions for your changes and the performance is also better compared to
run-time intergations. Therefore using module federation we can get the best of both worlds. It was introduced by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) and was in beta for quite a while and
now few months back they included it in [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/).

## Example

### TL;DR

You can find examples for the framework you need at [https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples](https://github.com/module-federation/module-federation-examples)

### Module federation in react

We'll look into a short example on how two apps can share a component from one to another using module federation. Lets assume that there are two apps,
`app-one` and `app-two` with basic working react and webpack configuration. We are trying to `federate` a `component` Button.jsx from
`app-one` to `app-two`. Module federation plugin is exported by container property in webpack package (i.e `const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require("webpack").container;`)

So for app-one which has the Button.jsx component the plugins array in webpack config will look something like this,

```js
const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require("webpack").container;

module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, "src", "index.js"), // root file of your react app
  output: {
    publicPath: "http://localhost:3000/", // port where your app will be loaded
    clean: true,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [...]
  },
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "app-one",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        "./Button": "./src/Button.jsx",
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

This means that our component will be bundled to `http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js` and is ready to be used in
our app-two. Now the plugins array in the webpack config of app-two should be like this,

```js
const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require("webpack").container;

module.exports = {
  entry: path.join(__dirname, "src", "index.js"), // root file of your react app
  output: {
    publicPath: "http://localhost:3001/", // port where your app will be loaded
    clean: true,
  },
  module: {
    rules: [...]
  },
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: "app-two",
      remotes: {
        "app-one": "app-one@http://localhost:3000/remoteEntry.js",
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

Thus the button component is available at `app-one/Button`, therefore your can do something like this to use that
button component

```jsx
import Button from "app-one/Button";

const Component = () => {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
};

export default Component;
```

Hence we were able to federate a component from one app and make it available in another app. Eventhough there are a few advantages
in module federation, they too have certain pitfalls, like it works well when two apps have to share resources. Modules can
be shared only between apps, but to expose components from a repo which is not an app you need to maintain a bundling tool for
it and make it available in a url or cdn. But if your use case is to share frontend modules between apps then module federation
is the best option available right now.
