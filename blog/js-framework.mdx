We have a lot of javascript frameworks out there and it is really difficult to choose one for your application. It is
also pretty hard to change your stack once you've started working on a framework. Therefore selecting an appropriate
framework is the single most important decision you might make for your project. But how do you choose the appropriate
one ? What are the metrics should you take into consideration ? Will the framework scale based on your use cases ? Learn
more about them in the upcoming portions of this blog.

I built the same application using five different frameworks, so that it would be easier to compare them and make the selection
process for you a lot easier. You can check out the source code [here](https://github.com/akshay9677/js-frameworks).

### Why do we need a framework ?

Before we jump into the comparision, let's try understanding an age old question - Why do we need a framework to start
with ? We have been building applications for 2 decades using javascript, as we build more ambitious applications, relying
only on vanilla javascript wouldn't have scaled. To understand it better try building any reusable components using vanilla
js and then using a js framework. Plain js is not straightforward, and building dynamic UI components is hard since they
were introduced as a supporting language for websites. Hence we have frameworks now, with which we can build more dynamic
and reusable stuffs with javascript as their primary language.

### The Application

The application I built, is a emoji search app, in which you can search emojis' based on a key word. It also generates
a random emoji each time you load the application. The application was written considering all the basic possiblities to
compare the metrics such as, ease of use, build time, build size, etc, needed to select a framework.

#### React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is the most popular javascript framework and has around 200k stars on github. It was
introduced by Facebook and is widely used by a lot of the leading companies. They are so popular, we even have a
lot of react based frameworks like [Next js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It is a
really great framework but I am not a fan of it's [documentation](https://reactjs.org/). It is really hard for beginners
and they are so improper. Also their build size is pretty large compared to the newer frameworks like svelte. Overall,
it is a great framework for beginners.

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros"}
  list={[
    "Easy to understand, mainly if your fluent in javascript. React uses jsx which is similar to javascript.",
    "Better community support and endless resource of libraries to make your life easier.",
    "Establishing reusable components is a piece of cake in react.",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons"}
  list={[
    "Poor documentation, hard for beginners",
    "Slow compared to non virtual-dom frameworks like svelte and solid js",
  ]}
/>

#### Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is also another popular and one of the oldest javascript frameworks, which was introduced
by google. They use typescript, which according to me should be a configurable option in frameworks and not as a default
syntax. Since this requires typescript, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are fluent in typescript or you're coming from
another typed programming language ðŸ˜‰. I am not completely against typescript, in-fact I've written a
[blog post](https://akshaykannan.tech/blog/typescript-importance) about it, but when it comes to frameworks typescript
should be configurable. Their build time is also not that great, and build size is really huge, largest among the 5 frameworks.

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros"}
  list={[
    "Angular allows two way binding between parent and child component.",
    "Easier DOM manipulation.",
    "Angular is regarded as a complete package since it has numerous built-in functionalities.",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons"}
  list={[
    "Typescript is not configurable",
    "Building complex re-usable components is hard and can become complex quickly.",
    "If you're from a react background like me, it will be hard to wrap your head around their base folder structure and how they establish props for their re-usable components.",
  ]}
/>

#### Vue

If you're selecting from the og frameworks (react, angular & vue), I would recomment going for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).
Vue js literally has the best of both worlds (react & angular). Vue uses virtual dom for reactivity like react whereas
it's syntax is a lot similar to angular. They have proper ecosystem for routing, global state management, build tool etc.
Vue has vue-cli with which you can configure the above ecosystem features and you can start developing right away. Whereas
in react you have to manually install all the required base functionalities before you can start developing. You
can still use [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) for react, but it is just a basic build tool with
fixed configurations.

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros"}
  list={[
    "Proper documentation, one of the best I've seen",
    "Uses virtual dom for reactivity",
    "Good for beginners",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons"}
  list={[
    "Vue is more framework-y compared to react, which does not have certain liberties you have in react.",
  ]}
/>

#### Svelte

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is one of the newest framework and I am a huge fan of svelte. I've written an entire blog
on svelte, you can check it [here](https://akshaykannan.tech/blog/svelte). The following are it's pros and cons,

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros"}
  list={[
    "High-speed rendering and top-notch performance",
    "Build sizes are small, since it is a no-production framework.",
    "Good for beginners",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons"}
  list={["Relatively new has a very little community support."]}
/>

#### Solid

This might be a suprising choice for most people, but I believe [Solid js](https://www.solidjs.com/) has some really great
potential. Solid is how I want react to be. I would recommend this if you want to have svelte like performance with react
like syntax. I was introduced to no virtual dom by svelte, eventhough it's syntax is easier to understand, it's relatively
new. But solid js uses jsx and has syntax similar to react. This is the most performant framework with build sizes as small
as 7kb (minified + gzipped).

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros"}
  list={[
    "The most performant among the others in this list.",
    "Smaller build sizes",
  ]}
/>

### Conclusion

Depending on the project requirements, one can choose any framework. For example, a developer can use React for short
projects that require a smaller learning curve, and another might choose svelte in order to have smaller build size.

There are other js frameworks that might have helped you with your developments such as BackboneJS, Emberjs,
Aureila, MeteorJS, etc. But here, I shortlisted the top five choices that are backed up by npm trends and popularity.
As an aspiring frontend developer, you may be feeling a little overwhelmed by the number of different frameworks to
choose from, but don't worry. You can start by learning one or two from the above list and gradually add more as you
become more comfortable.
