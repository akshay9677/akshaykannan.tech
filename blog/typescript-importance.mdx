When I started web development typescript was one of the "buzz words" I came accross a lot and so I decided
to learn about it after I had some knowledge in JS and web development as such. When I started going through typescript,
I had few doubts on what kind of project should I use typescript and should I use it in every app I build,
etc. So after some research I come to a conclusion and shared my thoughts on it.
This blog mainly concentrates on when to use typescript and when not to use it. I
have shared some basic setup guide for using typescript in your project.
I have also written about typescript in React and added a few examples for it.

Now a days Javascript is used everywhere, be it web apps, mobile apps or desktop apps
there is some framework out there that JS Developers can use to develop respective apps.
Eventhough it is used a lot, there are some issues in JS and one of the reasons for it is its dynamic
typing ability.

One classic example is NaN (Not a number). We get NaN when a mathematical calculation
cannot be represented as a number. This happens in one such case,

```js
let a = "hello";
let b = 1;
console.log(a - b); //Nan
```

The above code may look absurd, why would anyone subtract a string with a number, but imagine these
two variables are coming from different files, where, you are not sure of their types. During such
cases having typescript is really useful. This can be avoided by the following typescript code,

```ts
let a: string = "hello";
let b: number = 1;
console.log(a - b); //'Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number''
```

As you can see that variable `a` has a type annotation of string and `b` has a type annotation of number.
This annotation provides the data type for our variables
The following are some type annotation of typescript - Boolean, Number, String, Array, Tuple, etc

## When you should use Typescript ?

Typescript is a better choice when it comes to collabartion or when your working with large repositories. Companies
facing hardships in enforcing TDD (Test Driven Development) because of the bugs they have or encounter with, can start
off with typescript and slowly reduce minor bugs & issues in their repo. A [study](http://earlbarr.com/publications/typestudy.pdf)
shows that 15% of bugs are detected by typescript. But I feel that small projects or projects maintained
by a single person doesn't need to have typescript, because a single person maintaining the repo need not worry about
the types and similair is the case for small respositories.

Repositories following TDD or other testing flows can also incorporate typescripts. These kinds of repositories can
do property-based testing by using typescript.

But migrating a large repository entirely to typescript is a painstaking process. So it is a better choice to introduce
typescript for growing repositories. Typescript is better when it is paired with the right IDE. Since Typescript is introduced by Microsoft only VS Code was showing
type annotation mismatch, but now a days a lot of IDE's support typescript.

Now that you know what typescript does lets see a quick guide
on how to setup typescript.

## Typescript setup quick guide

### Typescript compiler

For typescript to work in your project you need a typescript compile `tsc`.
This typescript compiler compiles typescript code and produces a equivalent JS code.
To play around typescript and to learn typescript visit the [typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).
To add this compiler we can use npm, run the following command in your terminal

```shell
npm i -g typescript
```

### Migrating to Typescript

Typescript being a superset to JS, all javascript code are valid typescript code.
So intially you could change the extensions of js files from `.js` to `.ts` and start making necessary changes
to your repo.

## Typescript setup in React

To create a new repository with typescript support run the following in your CLI,

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript

# or if you have create-react-app installed globally

create-react-app my-app --template typescript

```

If you want to add typescript to existing react projects you can add the following npm packages
and start using typescript in your project. CRA already has typescript support so by running the following
command we can use typescript in our project.

```shell
npm i --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

### React Typescript

`Person.tsx` file

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface PersonDetailsProps {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string | undefined;
  id: number;
}

const Person: React.FC<PersonDetailsProps> = ({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  id,
}): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <div>
      <span>{id}</span>
      <span>{firstname + " " + lastName}</span>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Person;
```

As you can see that the person seeing this file knows that the prop `id` is a `number` and `lastName` & `firstName`
is of `string` annotation. Also `lastName` has two annotations `string` and `undefined`. So even if `lastName`
is not mentioned typescript compiler won't throw an error but it throws an error if `id` or `firstName` is not
mentioned or if there is a type mismatch.
There is a type `React.FC` for Person which denotes that is a React functional component.
Also there is another annotation `JSX.Element` in the function this is used to
mention what is the return type of a function. For example the below code has a return type of `number` and the arguments for
function `sub` also has types of `number` each.

```tsx
const sub = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a - b;
};

sub(2, 1); // 1
sub("helo", 1); // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
```

Therefore while reusing the component Person the programmer knows what props he should
give and their types either by looking into the file or from the suggestion provided by the IDE.
