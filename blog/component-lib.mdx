Component libraries is one of the things that I love in front-end development. The very idea of maintaining a library
of reusable components that other people can use, has always kept me excited and also, it has been a great learning experience so far.
The main reason I started this was to learn how each basic front-end component works, by building a
light-weight one.

**NOTE:**
I am using the term light-weight here because all the components in [ak-palette](https://ak-palette.netlify.app/) are simple & straight-forward and the properties exposed for each one of them are quite limited but sufficient
for a basic application.

# Planning

The following are the few goals that I set for this design system.

### Design

Before starting to build a component library the first thing you need is a proper design, I learned this the hard way. After
building a few components I felt that they were all inconsistent and had to re-write a lot of stuff.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com) is a great tool for designing and it is free. One small tip, no need to design all your components, re-use few designs like, if you design a input field,
the same can be applied for text area and similarly a design for a select field can be applied to a time picker component etc.

### Tech stack

#### React

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) was not the first framework I chose for this component library. I was planning to build this component library
using [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue), but since I was working in Vue in my company and eventually we might be building one there, I chose
react for this component library.

#### Typescript

I also was planning to use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in some of my projects and what better place could it
be than a component library. Typescript is one of the best decisions I made. Since I
am the only person maintaining this library (at the time of writing this blog), I see typescript as the extra set of eyes for
better development.

#### Docusaurus

For documentation purposes, I chose [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). Documentation can be the key reason for engaging people in any open source project
and it is as important as the library you are builidng. One of the reasons that makes me hate any library is improper documentation. So
documentation is the key for open source projects. When it comes to documentation there are a lot of resources, you can also write markdown files and
publish it though github pages.

If you have a vuejs component library, then try using [vuepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress). VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both
focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus
is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.

#### Story Book

I use [Story Book](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing isolated components faster. Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components.
You get a better insight about your components. Story book can also be used for documentation,
but I prefer docusaurus because of a better ui and you get more options for customizing your docs in docusaurus.

Check out [Anny Caroline's](https://medium.com/@annycarolinegnr/storybook-with-react-typescript-1c15a1cbc26a) blog on how to setup storybook for a react
typescript project.

#### Icons

Even if you not intend to have an icon library for you design system, you need few icons for certain components. For example, the
cross button for modals and sidesheets or the calendar icon in date-picker field. You can either
install a third-party icon library or if you want to maintain some consistency, you can design it in figma or sketch and then use them
in your project. I designed some of my icons in figma and used it in this library.

# Execution

After selecting the proper tools and finalizing designs, I started building the components. I used to establish the things I need to achieve for a
component and then started writing the code for it. I wrote the documentation for each component as and when I complete the code for it. So on an average it took me around
two days to finish a component along with documentation.

# Publishing / Distributing

I used [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) to generate a dist, which I use to publish it in NPM.
I prefered rollup over [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) because webpack reqiures a lot of bolier plate setup. The following is the current config
file for rollup,

```js
const packageJson = require("./package.json");

export default {
  input: "src/index.js",
  output: [
    {
      file: packageJson.main,
      format: "cjs",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
    {
      file: packageJson.module,
      format: "esm",
      sourcemap: true,
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    peerDepsExternal(),
    resolve(),
    commonjs(),
    typescript({ useTsconfigDeclarationDir: true }),
    postcss({ output: true }),
    svg({ base64: true }),
  ],
};
```

Since setting up was easier, I chose rollup for bundling, but for development I still use webpack with the configuration that
comes inside of create-react-app. I also use [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) for publishing my library.
And for the doumentation, bundling was handled by docusaurus itself and I am hosting it through netlify's free tier.
