## Optional Chaining

This is a new javascript feature where we can check whether a property is present in an object. Before when we try to access a nested property which is not defined then we get an error, this is fixed by a new syntax in JS

For Example:

```js
let obj = {
  name: {
    firstName: "Akshay",
    lastName: "Kannan",
  },
};
```

So now to access a property say name in property middleName which is not present in the object obj we can something like this,

```js
console.log(obj.middleName?.name);

// undefined
```

## Global This

In ES2020 there is a new keyword called `globalthis` which is similair to `this` but the only difference is that `globalthis` always refers to the global object, no matter where we are executing the code
For Example:

```js
function canMakeHTTPRequest() {
  return typeof globalThis.XMLHttpRequest === "function";
}

console.log(canMakeHTTPRequest());

// expected output (in a browser): true
```

## Promise All Settled

Promise object has a new method called `Promise.allSettled()` which is similair to `Promise.all()` , both accepts a promise array, the only difference is that allSettled will always get resolved with an array which gives us the result of whether the promises we passed are resolved or rejected

```js
function canMakeHTTPRequest() {
  return typeof globalThis.XMLHttpRequest === "function";
}

console.log(canMakeHTTPRequest());

// expected output (in a browser): true
```

## Nullish Coalescing

Before ES2020 null values are checked using falsey checks but there were no other way to check if a value is exactly null. In ES2020 we have a way to check them,

```js
null ?? "Null value";
// Null value

undefined ?? "Null value";
// Null value

false ?? "Null value";
// Null value
```

## Dynamic Imports

Dynamic import in javascript helps us to import files dynamically wherever we want.

```js
if (condition) {
  const calculator = import("./calculator.js");

  calculator.add(1, 2);
}
```
