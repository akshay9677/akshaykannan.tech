I published this website back in May 2020. Over the course of a year,
my website has gone through a lot of changes. Initially I was using Heroku for deployments, later I found out
about Netlify and migrated my deployments to it. Since I was using this repo for testing out new stuffs,
I have used a lot of react frameworks, css frameworks, and component libraries here.
This website has went through a lot of iteration and right now I am happy with my current tech stack. I am currently using,

- React
- Next JS
- Tailwind

    Ak Palette
  </a> (My Component library)
- Netlify

## React

React has been the longest contender for my website. Initially I had a basic css, html and javascript code base with node js
for development. Later when I was learning new stuffs in web-dev, react was the huge buzz word back then, so eventually I decided to learn
it by using it in this website.

I did not use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) back then, I went
through the painstaking process, of setting up react by myself, later I found out about create-react-app and set up react using it.
Because of create-react-app I had a better development environment. I was mind-blown by react, it facilitates the overall
process of writing components and also I was able to develop stuff faster with hot reloads.

## Next js

Next js was one of the latest addition to my website, I published my first blog last year December. I built it by having a rich text editor,
to post new blogs. Later I switched to MDX and I was setting it up using craco and a few mdx related loaders. I used craco to override the
default webpack configuration of create-react-app to add custom loaders and plugins. Later I learned about [Next Js](https://nextjs.org/)
from [Leerob's blog](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) and started incorporating it to my website.

Next js has a lot of advantages like static & server rendering, route pre-fetching, image optimization and much more. I really like
the file system based routing feature in next js, but I am not sure of how it would scale for larger apps, but for apps like mine, which does not
have any complex routing, file system based routing is good. One other thing I really loved was image optimization, images were optimized
and resized based on the device viewport. All I had to do was to use `next/image` component,

```js
import Image from "next/image";

<Image alt={`WASM`} src={`/WasmLogo.png`} width={2248} height={1000} />;
```

## Ak Palette

Before using my design system, I was using bootstrap library through a cdn and later installed it using node. The package was quite heavy
and there were a lot of unwanted code that was getting bundled, so I decided to build a design system which was light in weight and
easy to use.

After publishing my component library, I was looking for a project to test it. So i used it in my website. The buttons, input boxes and
toast message when you signup for my newsletter are all components of my design system. I built my design system using react and typescript.
Since there weren't much components I was using from bootstrap, migrating it to my component library was quite easy. Check out
[ak-palette documentation](https://ak-palette.netlify.app/) to learn more about it.

## Tailwind css

I was manually writing all my css, before I found out about tailwind. Tailwind is a low-level css framework, which gives you all the
building blocks, so that you don't have to leave your html.

For example the following code below can easliy be written in html using tailwind,

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

#### Tailwind

```html
<div className="flex flex-row items-center justify-center">...</div>
```

### Responsive Design

Previous versions of my websites were not responsive, I had a lot of issues viewing my website in mobile phones. I was
using media query back then and it was not scaling well, and I had to write css twice to target different screen sizes. Later
when I switched to tailwind writing responsive css was a breeze. The following is an example of changing widths of a div based
on screen size.

```html
<!-- Width of 16 by default, 32 on medium screens, and 48 on large screens -->
<div className="w-16 md:w-32 lg:w-48">...</div>
```

### Dark Mode

Dark mode is quite easy using tailwind where you can write classes targetting dark and light theme using the dark utility.
For example you can write an html as such,

```html
<div className="bg-gray-100	dark:bg-black text-gray-900	dark:text-white">...</div>
```

And then in js when a button is clicked or if dark mode is toggled you can write a method to change the classes for your
entire body tag.

```js
const changeTheme = () => {
  const body = document.querySelector("body");
  if (body.classList.contains("dark")) body.classList.remove("dark");
  else body.classList.add("dark");
};
```

## Netlify

I initially deployed my website using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) through its free tier. Deploying using heroku was easy and straight-forward, but I had some issues
with heroku. It puts my website to sleep after **30 hours of inactivity** , which increased the inital load time for my website.
They do it to preserve dyno hours from burning out or wasting, but I didn't have enough traffic for my website to keep it active always.

So I was looking for a change and later I learned about [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), I found out how easy it was to set up a continuous deployment pipeline for my website, so I decided
to switch to netlify. Switching to netlify was easy, all I had to do was to configure my github repo in netlify, enter my build script and select my
build directory.

## Conclusion

Even right now the tech stack I shared above won't last longer. When a new technology comes, I am sure that I will try to use it
in my website. I felt like sharing this because I believe for a website for posting blogs and maintaining a portfolio, this stack
is more than sufficient. For peeps who are looking for chosing your stack for your blog, can actually use this.
