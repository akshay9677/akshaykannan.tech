JavaScript being one of the most popular languages, itâ€™s a favorite for web development both on the front and back-end.
And as such, there are a lot of js frameworks out there, and a new js framework is being released every month. Even though
there are a lot of js framework, [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) &
[Angular](https://angular.io/) have been the top contenders. Svelte an even new framework has been gaining a lot of attention
in the recent days. There are a lot of interesting things in Svelte. Learn more on why svelte stands out from the existing list
of frameworks in this blog.

## What is Svelte ?

Svelte is a **Javascript framework** which is used to construct user interfaces, similar to React, Vue, etc. However unlike react and
vue it does not use the [Virtual dom](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html). This is what actually caught my eye, it rises a lot of questions like how does reactivity
works with svelte. To learn about no virtual dom in svelte, let's see what is a virtual dom.

### Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM is nothing but a shallow object / copy of the actual DOM, which has information of how our web page might look like. So
frameworks like react and vue uses this virtual dom to update the state of the web page, they compare the dom with the virtual
dom, whenever there is a change they update the virtual dom.

As you can see react and vue rely on an API which compares virtual DOM and actual DOM to make changes to our page. So this api
should be there in our bundled code for reactivity to work. Without this api, there is no way for the framework to know when to
update the virtual dom. Thus, a lot of framework code might be injected into the browser, which might slow your
apps performance compared to a framework without this api.

:::tip note
Frameworks using **Virtual DOM** are **fast** but it comes with a few limitations. As it helps developers to concentrate on more
creative tasks rather than focussing on reactivity and performance, it is used in lot of frameworks despite the limitations.

### Svelte - No Virtual DOM

Svelte is such a framework that does not use Virtual DOM. Svelte, compiles the code to tiny frame less vanilla JavaScript bundle,
which updates DOM whenever state changes. This means the reactivity runs on the compiler, instead of relying on an API to do so.
Therefore no overhead framework code is injected into our browser, this also means Svelte will not be present in our production
build, thus it is called as a "**disappearing framework**". This increases app's performance to a great extent.

## Simple Syntax

Most framework, provide complex syntax and a lot boiler plate codes. Svelte provides a simple syntax, with less code compared to other
frameworks out there. Most frameworks use hooks and other ways to declare reactive properties. In svelte you can simple declare
them as javascript variables and updating them updates all the places where the variable is used. A short comparision of same
functionality (button with counter) in different frameworks.

### React

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const handleClick = () => count++;

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>You have clicked {count} times</button>;
};
```

### Vue

```jsx
<template>
  <button @click="handleClick">
    You have clicked {{ count }} times
  </button>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleClick() {
      this.count = this.count + 1;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

### Svelte

```jsx
<script>
let count = 0
const handleClick = () => count++
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>You have clicked {count} times</button>
```

## Getting Started

Since svelte is more of like a compiler, we won't be importing the framework's api code in our root file. We can create a sample
project with minimal development setup by running the following command.

```shell
npx degit sveltejs/template svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

This will clone a basic template with all the necessary dependencies required to get started on Svelte. After cloning you can install
the dependencies and run the dev command to start the server.

One interesting thing that you might notice in package.json is that the svelte core dependency is in the dev dependencies ðŸ¤¯. This
is because, as mentioned earlier svelte won't be in the production code because of its no virtual DOM and relying on the compiler
for reactivity.

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

This svelte clone uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) to compile/rebuild the svelte code using the configuration mentioned in `rollup.config.js`
file. You can add new plugins or edit plugins in the config file. We can also use webpack to compile svelte using the appropriate
plugins. Thus we were able to setup a simple svelte project, learn more about svelte's basics in their [documentation](https://svelte.dev/).
