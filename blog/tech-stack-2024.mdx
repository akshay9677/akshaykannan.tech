Hey guys, It's been a year since my last post. I've been busy with some personal stuff. Built a design system in my
primary job.... additionally, I've been working on numerous personal projects this year. I've
experimented with various tools and techs, and so I've finally settled on a few things, that will stick around for a while
([hopefully](https://nadh.in/blog/javascript-ecosystem-software-development-are-a-hot-mess/)).

## Framework

To be honest, I haven't worked with many frameworks this year; it's mainly been Vue and React for me. If I had to choose
between them, I'd prefer React. Consequently, I've been using React-based frameworks and even if you don't, people around you
bully you into using one and the one I've adopted is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). One interesting thing I did this year was to
migrate to App router.

### Next.js - App router

First of all, if you've been using page router extensively, there is some serious learning curve here. We won't have to use
`getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` anymore, which is a pretty great thing ;-) . And it is quite fun to use react
server components. But I've some mixed opinions about it, I've discussed a few of them below,

#### 1) Server components

Next.js App Router's server components promise performance improvements. This approach allows you to render essential page
sections on the server while maintaining client-side reactivity for interactive elements. Imagine an application fetching data
for a list: the data fetching and list rendering components could be server components, while sorting and other interactive
functionalities could remain client-side. For me this is a game changer, I was wrote a lot of server components and if I need
interactivity I would simply write components with "use client" tag.

<br />

Additionally, server components eliminate the complexity
associated with managing useEffect hooks. `useEffect` can be tricky to manage. RSC simplifies things by eliminating the need
for it entirely.

```jsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/...");

  if (!res.ok) {
    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch data");
  }

  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();

  return <main></main>;
}
```

#### 2) Layouts

App Router's layouts are a game-changer! Previously, I'd create separate layouts for different page types and import
them into each page. Now, a single layout.js file at the root can define the layout structure, simplifying my application
code across various routes.

#### 3) File based routing

I've never been a fan of file based routing. While file-based routing offers simplicity, it can introduce maintainability
challenges. Having multiple files with the same name (e.g., page.tsx, metadata.tsx) makes searching specific files difficult.
Additionally, implementing dynamic routes with parameters in between routes (like /products/:productId/details) can become
difficult, potentially requiring extra folders.

<br />

Overall I would recommend using App router (for now), also I've seen a few people complain about the development
performance, it is the same as page router for me, nothing much to complain about it.

## Typescript

Just use them already ðŸ˜‰ !

## Styling

I've been using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the past two years and it's become my go-to for building
design systems. Tailwind makes establishing themes and global tokens a breeze. You can write multiple css variables based on
different themes under each class and simply switch the theme class to change the tokens,

```css
// global.css
.theme-light {
  --container: #ffffff;
  --content: #000000;
}

.theme-dark {
  --container: #000000;
  --content: #ffffff;
}
```

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
    colors: {
      container: "var(--container)",
      content: "var(--content)",
      // ...
    },
  },
};
```

<br />
Initially, I considered Uno.css, but Tailwind eventually caught up in features, this
led me to switch back. Recently, I've been focusing on responsiveness in a few projects,
which is also simpler with Tailwind. As a result, my CSS footprint has shrunk significantly.
Now, I only write external CSS for complex animations and transitions.

## Interactions & Animations

This year, I've been delving into user interactions and animations. I came across [this](https://rauno.me/craft/interaction-design)
blog, which led me to focus on micro-interactions to enhance user experience. Animations play a crucial role in this approach.
Initially, I was writing my own CSS for animation, but I've since transitioned to [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
You can do a lot with framer, I do recommend checking it out!

<br />

CSS clip-path has become a recent favorite tool. It allows for precise control over the visible portions of an element,
effectively hiding anything outside the defined path. This technique unlocks creative possibilities for web design.
Check out [this](https://css-tricks.com/animating-with-clip-path/) blog for more
details. I'm planning on writting an entire blog about it, stay tuned :-).

## Hosting

Frontend application hosting has become a well-established landscape. While I previously used [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
I've migrated to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) several years ago and haven't looked back. I've also experimented with
[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/), which offers a solid solution. However, for my current needs, Vercel remains my
preferred choice.
