Vercel, the provider of a popular development platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, has brought in interesting
products into their wing. After pulling in Svelte and it's creator Rich Harris into their suit of products, it is most likely that
all the frontend developers might be using atleast a few vercel products in the future. Below are the few projects that are owned
by vercel, that I really look forward to.

## Next js

Next is the most famous among the vercel products. It is a framework based on React. Next.js is a server-rendered
React framework that requires little or no configuration. It has a lot of features like static site generation,
server side rendering, route pre-fetching, image optimization and much more. It gives a really **good developer**
experience with all the features you need for production. Next js can help us improve the performance, UX and SEO
of the web page.

I personally like nextjs and this website is built on it. I really love the in-built image optimization and file system
based routing system in next. I haven't had a chance to work on it, in a large project, but won't hesitate in chosing
next js, if a react based solution is required.

## Vercel

Eventhough it is the core product of the vercel ecosystem, only recently I got a chance to use it when I migrated this website's
deployments from netlify. Vercel is made for production, it has support for automative deployments where a simple
push to git or bitbucket will start the build and deploy it. It facilitates fron-end deployment and it is does not require
a lot of configuration, similar to next js.
