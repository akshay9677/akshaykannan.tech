Vercel, the provider of a popular development platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, has brought in few interesting
products into their wing. After pulling in [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte), along with it's creator [Rich Harris](https://github.com/Rich-Harris)
, it is more likely that all the frontend developers might be using atleast a few vercel products in their applications, in the future.
They have a lot of interesting tools, below are the few tools that are owned by vercel, that I really look forward to.

## Next js

[Next js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) is the most famous among them. It is a framework based on React. Next.js is a server-rendered
React framework that requires little or no configuration. It has a lot of features like static site generation,
server side rendering, route pre-fetching, image optimization and much more. It gives a really good developer
experience with all the features you need for production. Next js can help us improve the performance, UX and SEO
of the web page.

I personally like nextjs and this website is built on it. I really love the in-built image optimization and file system
based routing system in next. I haven't had a chance to work on it, in a large project, but won't hesitate in chosing
next js, if a react based solution is required.

## Vercel

Eventhough it is the core product of the vercel ecosystem, I got a chance only recently to use it when I migrated this website's
deployments from netlify. [Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/vercel) is made for production, it has support for automative deployments where a simple
push to git or bitbucket will start the build and deploy it. It facilitates front-end deployment and it is does not require
a lot of configuration, similar to next js. Combined with next js, websites can be developed, built and deployed faster.

## Turborepo

Monorepos are hot right now, especially among Web developers. But without the right tool it can be a nightmare to maintain them
. There are a lot of tools out there for maintaining monorepo. One such tool is [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo),
which is now acquired by Vercel. It is more of like a build system than a simple tool like [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna).
The following are the features that turborepo offers,

- Build artifacts are cached, so the next time you run your build it will only run the stuff that requires it. In other words
  turborepo remembers what you've built.

- Builds are remotely cached which means you can share the build with your teammates or with the CI/CD for faster builds.

- Content is king, turborepo checks the content of your files, rather than the timestamp.

Check out [this](https://monorepo.tools/) link which compares different tools for maintaining monorepos which showcases all the
features turborepo has.

## Next UI

Design systems and component libraries are one of the major pillars in web development. They help in acheiving desing consistency
and uniformity throughout the app. There are a lot of desing systems, the following are few of my favourite ones,

- [Evergreen by Segment](https://evergreen.segment.com/)
- [Atlassian design](https://atlassian.design/)
- [Github's primer](https://primer.style/).

I choose a design system based on the design, how easy is it to setup and how customizabe is it. Next UI pretty much satisfies all
these conditions. There are a very few design systems which comes with an in built dark theme, next UI is one such library. They have some really
cool animation for their components and they are easily customizable. You can either customize the theme or override certain component's
css with a special prop called `css`. They are still in beta but I really love their design and have used it in this website.

## Svelte

As mentioned earlier svelte is a recent addition to the vercel family and this is really interesting because Svelte is a standalone
open source project, with Vercel supporting them, they can really grow. As mentioned in my previous [blog](http://localhost:3000/blog/svelte)
I really love the way Svelte views the front-end framework space. They have almost 50k stars in github and with Vercel behind
them they can be ambitious. Vercel bringing in Svelte is quite understandable, because both aim at making web development easier
and with Vercel's recent [funding](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-funding-series-d-and-valuation) they can easily maintain a big
project like Svelte.

## Conclusion

Vercel may or may not shape the world of web development, but they have some interesting tools which has really great potential. With their
recent funding it is more likely of them to acquire even more open source projects, which can make the lives of front-end
developers a lot easier ðŸ˜‰.
