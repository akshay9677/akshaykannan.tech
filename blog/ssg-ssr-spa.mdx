There are a lot of techniques / approaches that are followed by Javascript frameworks for rendering the
files that we write. Certain JS frameworks do **Client Side Rendering** where when a request is hit by the browser,
only a html will be served which has a lot of javascript code which will handle the page rendering, there are **Single Page Applications (SPA)**,
in which the routes are handled by JS, where changing the route does not necessarily reload
the page only the content will be changed, there is **Server Side Rendering**, where the contents are loaded dynamically
or statically generated on demand from the server and finally there is **Static Site Generation**, where the pages are pre-rendered and serves a
fully rendered page on request to avoid load time.

Each have their own pros and cons, and since there are a lot of approaches and each framework follow either one
or a combination of more than one technique, it is hard to chose one to suit your needs. In this post, we will
tackle the above patterns for front-end web development, to see what they bring to the table and how you can implement
them today with the proper tools.

## Client Side Rendering

Client Side rendering is one of the traditional approaches used by a lot of javascript frameworks. In this architecture,
only a single html is rendered and the frameworks api code or javascript code is used to render the main stuff which has the
page's actual contents. In other words the **server will only return an plain html, which has references to the necessary javascript
bundles and this will actually render the web page**, based on the framework's api.

Thus the page is rendered on client side. React, Vue and Angular are the frameworks who follow this approach. This approaches is mainly
used when you're app's data is changing a lot and you don't care about SEO. So doing SSR or SSG in that case won't be ideal. In most
companies the product itself is built as SPAs and the product websites are built by using SSG and SSR.

#### Basic Flow

On a request from the client, the server will render the html file which will have all the code for rendering the pages on user interaction
or request. Since the server will serve only the initial html and the bundled code does all the rendering they are called client side rendering.

### Single Page Applications

Single page applications are a subset of CSR, where all SPAs are CSR and not all CSRs are SPAs. In SPAs the route change does not
reload the entire page, only the contents of the page or a part of the page are changed and this is done by javascript. All the
frameworks mentioned above also fall under this category

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros on using SPA"}
  list={[
    "SPAs can be done in case of client side rendering, cannot be done in any other approach.",
    "Really useful when you have data that changes a lot.",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons on using SPA"}
  list={[
    "The bundles which will render the web page if are large can be costly and can slow the app because of network problems.",
    "SPAs are not SEO friendly since there will be only one HTMl file and all the main content are served by javascript and the framework api.",
  ]}
/>

## Server Side Rendering

In server side rendering the page is **pre-rendered** or executed in the server itself and **served on demand**. Here the term on demand is
important because javascript is served and rendered on server only on user request. Thus the pre-rendered page are served on run
time. Next js, Svelte Kit all do SSR. These are used when your data keeps on changing and you need a really good SEO.

#### Basic Flow

On each request from client, the page is rendered on the server which is defined by the api (React, Vue, Angular, etc) and then they
are quickly served, rather than using a js bundle to render or directly rendering on client. As mentioned above rendering happens on
server not on the client side by javascript.

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros on using SSR"}
  list={[
    "Can be used when you have data that changes a lot and is recommended if a proper SEO rating is required",
    "Lot faster than SPA because they processed in server rather than downloading the javascript and then rendering the pages",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons on using SSR"}
  list={[
    "Less flexibility, can be hard to change stacks",
    "Requires frequent calls to server for rendering content",
  ]}
/>

## Static Site Generation

In SSG, the **rendering happens during the build time itself**, so on each request, the users need not wait for the page to
load, the page will directly be rendered. The rendered html files are stored in a another file and then served faster on user request.
Here the rendering happens in build rather than on a server, which makes them even faster than SSR.
Next js and Svelte kit also support SSG along with SSR, so you can use these to get the best of both worlds.

#### Basic Flow

On each request from client, the already rendered pages are served from the server. Here the page is rendered and stored during the build
time itself, making it faster than SSR

<ProsCons
  isPro={true}
  header={"Pros on using SSG"}
  list={[
    "Fastest approach for rendering static contents.",
    "Overall has the best performance compared to other approaches.",
  ]}
/>

<ProsCons
  isPro={false}
  header={"Cons on using SSG"}
  list={[
    "Requires a build process when content is changed and are not recommended for sites that have contents that change frequently.",
    "If used for frequently changing content then requires a complex CI/CD process to build your code everytime a change has to reach the end user.",
  ]}
/>

## Frameworks that provide SPA, SSR & SSG

- React/Preact - SPA
- Next.js: SPA/SSR/SSG
- Create React App: SPA
- Gatsby: SSG
- Vue CLI: SPA
- Nuxt: SSR/SSG
- Vuepress/Vitepress: SSG
- Svelte Template: SPA
- SvelteKit: SSR/SSG

## Conclusion

Each technique has it's own merits and demerits, appart from the above parameters, there are various other variables like
ease of use, development friendly which should also be considered when selecting a architecture. For beginners trying to learn
the different architectures, I would recommend using Next js, which has all the approaches that are mentioned and can be
really useful to get an idea about each one.
