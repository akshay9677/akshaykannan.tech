Serverless architecture helps you write short programmatic functions which are used to carry out a small piece of functionality.
These serverless functions can then be hosted and maintained in any cloud service provider. This helps developers to
write small parts of codes without actually creating a dedicated service for a isolated functionality.
All leading cloud computing platform has serverless functions, right now we are going to take look on how to
deploy a serverless function using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Firebase firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore).

# Getting Started

In this guide, we will be building a function for counting and fetching views for a blog posting website. This view counter is currently
being used in this website. You can either follow along or view the finished repo [here](https://github.com/akshay9677/personalWebsite).

# Netlify setup

Install `netlify` sdk globally using npm or yarn

```shell
npm i -g netlify
```

[Netlify's js sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/netlify) automatically detects the type of project you have (react, vue, next js, etc.) and runs the necessory scripts to
setup the right environment for developing locally. `netlify dev` command helps you run your site locally, along with the functions
you will be adding. Therefore you can have the functions inside the same repo. It also injects any environment variables you
configured in netlify's dashboard for this project. Since we are using [firebase firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
as the database, we will be saving our service json inside this environment variable (firebase setup is discussed in detail
in the next part).

Before installing required packages, create a netlify.toml file to configure your serverless function. This netlify.toml
file should contain the information about the directory name where you have your functions and also you can mention redirects
here if you have any. Add the following configuration file,

```toml
[build]
  functions = "functions"
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to="/.netlify/functions/:splat"
  status = 200
```

Mention the directory where your function resides under [build] and also mention your api redirects under [[redirects]]. By default
all your netlify functions are triggered when /.netlify/functions/:splat endpoint is called, in order to use a custom endpoint
you have to configure it in the toml file. Therefore if you have a function in a file called "views" in "functions" directory, fetching
`/api/views` executes that function.

# Firebase setup

- Create a firebase account and create a new project.
- Navigate to Firestore Database tab and click on "Create Database"
- Select test mode and click next.

  src={`/firebase-setup/firebase-test-mode.png`}

  priority={true}
/>

- Now select the location for your database and click on enable.
- Click on project settings on the top right of the side bar and navigate to "Service Accounts" tab and
  click "Generate new private key"
- Download and save the json file, the contents of this file are configured as SERVICE_JSON environment variable
  in netlify.

  alt={`firebase-test-mode`}
  src={`/firebase-setup/service-accounts.png`}

  height={950}
  priority={true}

- Copy the contents of the service json file and create a .env file in your root and add the contents for the
  SERVICE_JSON env inside it. Also paste this contents in the same env name in netlify's function dashboard under environmental variables
  tab.

Install dotenv and firebase-admin

```shell
npm i dotenv firebase-admin
```

# The Function

The functions you write must export a handler method with the following general syntax:

```js
exports.handler = async function (event, context, callback) {
  // your server-side functionality
};
```

The event argument has the information about the current request, from which we will be using the body to get
the info about the page we want to update the view for

```json
{
    "path": "Path parameter",
    "httpMethod": "Incoming request’s method name",
    "headers": {Incoming request headers},
    "queryStringParameters": {Query string parameters},
    "body": "A JSON string of the request payload",
    "isBase64Encoded": "A boolean flag to indicate if the applicable request payload is Base64-encoded"
}
```

After writing you business logic you can have a callback with a return statement which has the information about the
request's response in it.

Create "functions" folder in your root and add a file called "views" inside it. Add the following code inside that
file,

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const admin = require("firebase-admin");

if (!admin.apps.length) {
  admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert(JSON.parse(process.env.SERVICE_JSON)),
  });
}

const db = admin.firestore();

exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
  const { slug } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  const ref = db.collection("views").doc(slug);

  let doc = await ref.get();
  let currentViews;
  if (doc.exists) {
    let { views } = doc.data();
    currentViews = views + 1;
    ref.update({ views: currentViews });
  } else {
    currentViews = 1;
    ref.set({ views: 1 });
  }

  return callback(null, {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      views: currentViews,
    }),
  });
};
```

As you can see from the above code we get the record from current posts' slug / id. Now if a record with that slug does not exists,
we add a new record with that slug and add the value as 1 for `views` field or increament the views value for existing record with that slug.
This function `updates / creates` and also gets the `current views` of the blog post.

**Note** Slug here is a unique name for each blog in your case it can also be an id.

You can either have the db intialization part here or abstract it to a seperate file under a
'helpers' folder inside functions directory. Netlify will use only the files inside functions not the folders inside it.

# Using the function

Since we have the function inside "views" file and since we have added redirects for `/api/*` we can call this function
using /api/views endpoint. The following code can be called to call that function inside your target file.

```js
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [views, setViews] = useState(0);
useEffect(() => {
  fetchViews();
}, []);

const fetchViews = async () => {
  setLoading(true);
  try {
    const res = await fetch("/api/views", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ slug: frontMatter.slug }),
    });
    const data = await res.json();
    let { views: blogViews } = data || {};
    setViews(blogViews);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
  setLoading(false);
};
```

# Conclusion

After pushing your code, your functions will be deployed ✨. You can now see your function in netlify, inside the functions tab of your project. You can also add
multiple functions for different functionalities and maintain them in the same repository.

A single function component can be used for executing different related actions like to get all the views for each post, you can add a another
if check that checks the http method,

```js
exports.handler = async function (event, context, callback) {
  if (event.httpMethod === "POST") {
    // update and get view for one post
  } else if (event.httpMethod === "GET") {
    // get views for all the posts
  }
};
```
