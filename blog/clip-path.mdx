Effective web interactions are crucial for enhancing user engagement and improving overall usability. They make navigation intuitive and create a memorable user experience,
reinforcing brand identity. In the current market, web interactions are the cherry on top, elevating a good design to an exceptional one.

<br />
One such tool that I've been using recently for improving web interactions is `clip-path`,
and the things you could do with it is limitless.

## Introduction

The clip-path property in CSS is used to define a clipping region for an element, allowing you to control which parts of the element are visible.
This property creates a "mask" that clips the element's content to a specific shape, effectively hiding the portions outside of that shape.

<ClipPath comp="intro" />

```css
.clip-container {
  clip-path: xywh(0 5px 100% 75% round 15% 0);
}
```

It was challenging to create complex shapes at first, but after discovering [Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/), I could easily generate any shape I needed.
Just drag and arrange the shape you want, then copy the corresponding clip-path CSS.

<br />

So far, I've primarily been using the inset property in clip-path, which allows you to specify the position of the
sides and define how much of the element you want to clip. For example, if you want to clip 50% from the top, you'd
use `inset(50% 0px 0px 0px);`, or if you want to clip 50% from the right, you'd use `inset(0px 50% 0px 0px)`;

Animating it is so breezy, dynamically updating the clip-path should do the trick after giving the transition property.

<ClipPath comp="animating" />

## Applications

There are many interactions and animations you can create using `clip-path`. One popular example is the image transition animation, which is commonly used across various websites.
A notable implementation of this can be seen on the [Vercel Security page](https://vercel.com/security).

<ClipPath comp="imageSwitch" />
<br />

This is a simple example involving two images: one without a text stroke and another with a text stroke positioned beneath the first (using position absolute). On mouse
move, the top image is clipped based on the mouse position, revealing the image with the text stroke underneath.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import NormalText from "public/text.svg";
import NormalTextWithStroke from "public/text-stroke.svg";

const TextStroke = () => {
  const [linePos, setLinPos] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div
      className="flex w-full relative"
      onMouseMove={(e) => {
        const rect = e.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect();
        setLinPos(e.clientX - rect.left);
      }}
    >
      <NormalText style={{ clipPath: `inset(0px 0px 0px ${linePos}px)` }} />
      <NormalTextWithStroke />
    </div>
  );
};

export default TextStroke;
```

<br />

Another interesting example is the tab switch animation, a widely used interaction. This effect is on [Stripe's blog](https://stripe.com/blog) page, providing a smooth and visually
appealing transition between tabs.

<br />

The usual approach I used was to position an absolute element behind the tabs and adjust its position and width based on the selected tab. This method is currently implemented on the
[blog list](https://akshaykannan.tech/blogs) page of this app. However, it becomes problematic when you need to switch the internal CSS of the selected item.

<ClipPath comp="tabSwitch" />

In this new approach, I render a list of tabs beneath the existing ones, and instead of adjusting positions, I simply clip the necessary element out of it. Below is the unclipped
element placed above the existing tabs.

<ClipPath comp="tabSwitchDefault" />

## Examples

Clip-path can be used in various creative ways on the web. For example, [Anthony Fu's](https://antfu.me/) website features a classic
implementation of clip-path in its theme switcher. By rendering the dark theme as the background and gradually
clipping away the necessary parts, the transition between themes is smooth and visually engaging.

<br />
<Image
  alt={"theme"}
  src="/gif/theme-switch.gif"
  width={2200}
  height={1350}
  priority={true}
  unoptimized={true}
/>
<br />
Another interesting example is the path flow animation on [Superpower’s](https://superpower.com/)
site. Although they didn't use clip-path for this effect, a similar path fill could
be achieved by clipping the path tag inside the svg using clip-path.

<br />
<Image
  alt={"path"}
  src="/gif/path-flow.gif"
  width={2200}
  height={1350}
  priority={true}
  unoptimized={true}
/>
