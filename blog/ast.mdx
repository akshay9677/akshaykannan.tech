If you are a front-end engineer who has some experience around front-end tools like prettier, eslint, webpack, rollup, vite, etc.,
learning ASTs can be quite handy. There are a lot of things you can do using AST, for instance you can write
[codemods](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), which modifies our original source code using the transformer we write using
ASTs, can be used to remove unwanted stuffs from our code base. Another interesting use case is
[writing a custom eslint plugin](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins), check out
[this blog](https://akshaykannan.tech/blog/custom-eslint-plugin) to write your own eslint plugin, can be used to introduce new eslint
rules, which are outside of existing eslint configurations.

## Why do we need AST ?

Have you ever wondered how eslint or prettier or even webpack work, they just collect the code we write and give a result, which can
be a modified version of our code or give back other stuffs like warnings / errors on the code we wrote (linters). They are written
on javascript, which can be confusing because they manipulate or do stuff on the javascript code we write but they themselves are
written in js. This concept is called `meta-programming` where programs treat other programs as thier input / data. Let's break down
the problem and see where AST comes in here.

- In order to change our js code we need to have the code in a format that can be understood using js.
- This format should have all the information right from imports to variable creation to exports from our js file.
- The better way can be to represent it in a tree format which branches out right from the starting line having info about each token of our code.
- If the format is a tree it can be represented as an javascript object as well (deep nesting the nodes as properties of the parent).

So we should have a parser, which should go through the code we give and return a tree / object representation of the code, so that we
can tap into different properties which might be different tokens of our code. That tree is an AST and this why we need it.

## Parsers

As discussed above we need a parser to get an AST of our code. There are a lot of parser right now, the following are a few of those,

- [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
- [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn)
- [esprima](https://github.com/jquery/esprima)
- [shift](https://github.com/shapesecurity/shift-parser-js)

Each parser have their own AST implementation, let's consider babel parser, the following is a tree generated from the below javascript code,

#### Code

```js
let number = 10;
```

As you can see from the code we have a variable declaration with variable name number with value name. This following is the ast for that line,

#### AST for code

```js
{
  type: "File",
  errors: [],
  program: {
    type: "Program",
    sourceType: "module",
    interpreter: null,
    body: [
      {
        type: "VariableDeclaration", // variable declaration
        declarations: [
          {
            type: "VariableDeclarator",
            id: {
              type: "Identifier",
              name: "number", // name of the variable
            },
            init: {
              type: "NumericLiteral",
              extra: {
                rawValue: 10,
                raw: "10", // value of that variable
              },
              value: 10,
            },
          },
        ],
        kind: "let", // declaration type
      },
    ],
    directives: [],
  },
  comments: [],
};
```

You can check out [Ast explorer](https://astexplorer.net/) site for playing around with different parser and write transformers for each
parser. You can check out [this](https://tomassetti.me/parsing-in-javascript/) post on how a parser works to generate an AST.
