I find build tools endlessly interesting and we seem to have a lot of 'em today. Now a days, it is easier to select a framework,
than to choose an optimal build tool. If you are a front-end developer, you must've heard about or tried to wrap your
head around module bundlers or build tools. Have you ever wondered how each build tool works ? Let's learn how a build tool
works internally, by building a basic one.

## What are module bundlers ?

Bundlers help in bundling different pieces of javascript code that we write, into a single complex / larger javascript file.
We can also provide loaders to support files that are not javascript, so that image assets, css assets, etc, can also
be bundled inside our js file, which makes it easier to serve it to the browser. We do this, because for a long time
browsers did not support module system,
[but it is not completely true now a days.](https://philipwalton.com/articles/using-native-javascript-modules-in-production-today/)
So if we give an entry point to the build tools, all the dependencies and the sub dependencies of it's dependencies will
be bundled together.

For building a basic javascript module bundler we should figure out the following things,

- Resolve the dependencies of the files that are imported or required.
- Remove any unused dependency from the bundle.
- Maintain the order of the files that are included.
- Resolve import statements, by differentiating node_modules and relatively imported modules.

So there are two ways our code will be bundled, to understand it let us compare how rollup and webpack will bundle the
following files, if `app.js` is provided as an entry file

```js
// add.js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
export default add;
```

```js
// diff.js
const diff = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
export default diff;
```

```js
// app.js
import add from "./add.js";
import diff from "./diff.js";

console.log(add(1, 2));
console.log(diff(2, 1));
```

## Webpack

```js
const modulemap = {
  "add.js": function (exports, require) {
    exports.default = function add(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    };
  },
  "diff.js": function (exports, require) {
    exports.default = function diff(a, b) {
      return a - b;
    };
  },
  "app.js": function (exports, require) {
    const add = require("add.js").default;
    const diff = require("diff.js").default;

    console.log(add(1, 2));
    console.log(diff(2, 1));
  },
};
```

The above is a cleaned up code [click here](https://gist.github.com/akshay9677/de14f580127be319ae340c3452a33b78), to check
out the actual bundled code by webpack,

We have three files, add.js, diff.js, and app.js, app.js imported the first two modules and also has a console statement.
As you can see from the above example,

- Webpack creates a module map for each module we have. The map was created with file name as property names and content
  inside the properties are methods with code from each module.
- Also each method has exports and require arguments to import and export the contents within each module.
- Thus when our dev server is started webpack uses the entry path and by creating the above module
  map it starts serving the bundled code.

## Rollup

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

const diff = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

console.log(add(1, 2));
console.log(diff(2, 1));
```

On first glance the rollup way of bundling seems light and straight forward, it bundles each code in the order of
dependencies to avoid [temporal dead zone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz)
and finally the entry point is present in the last portion of the bundled code. Thus we can try to mimic the rollup way
of bundling in this blog.

## Building a module bundler

The following are the steps for building your own module bundler,

- Create a module graph with it's dependencies.
- Bundle the modules with respect to the module graph.
- Write the bundled code in the target location.

```js
function builder({ input, ouput }) {
  // create module graph
  const moduleGraph = createModuleGraph(input);
  // bundle the modules
  const bundledCode = bundle(moduleGraph);
  // write the bundled code in the output location
  fs.writeFileSync(output, bundledCode, "utf-8");
}
```

### 1. Creating a module graph

We need to write a ModuleGraph class, which will hold the info about each modules' path,
it's dependencies, content, AST, etc. We will be using ASTs (Abstract Syntax Tree) for manipulating the contents of each
file and knowing it's dependencies, to learn more about ASTs
[check out this blog](http://localhost:3000/blog/custom-eslint-plugin#abstract-syntax-tree). For constructing the AST of
a javascript file we will be using `@babel/core` package here.

```js
const babel = require("@babel/core");

class ModuleGraph {
  constructor(input) {
    this.path = input;
    // get content of the current module
    this.content = fs.readFileSync(input, "utf-8");
    // will return an ast of the module
    this.ast = babel.parseSync(this.content);
  }
}
```

We can use babel's parseSync method to get an ast of a module. Thus the above class can be used to create module objects
with all the required info. Now let's see how to create a module dependency graph.

```js
function createModuleGraph(input) {
  return new ModuleGraph(input);
}
```

This method will be called to create a dependency graph. But from the ModuleGraph class above we won't have any
dependencies related info so let us change the ModuleGraph class a bit,

```js
class ModuleGraph {
  constructor(input) {
    this.path = input;
    this.content = fs.readFileSync(input, "utf-8");
    this.ast = babel.parseSync(this.content);
    // store the dependencies of the current module
    this.dependencies = this.getDependencies();
  }

  getDependencies() {
    return (
      this.ast.program.body
        // get import statements
        .filter((node) => node.type === "ImportDeclaration")
        .map((node) => node.source.value)
        // resolve the path of the imports
        .map((currentPath) => resolveRequest(this.path, currentPath))
        // create module graph class for the resolved dependencies
        .map((absolutePath) => createModuleGraph(absolutePath))
    );
  }
}
```

From the above code we can see that, we need to

- Get imports from ast.
- Resolve the dependencies' path and create module graph for each dependencies.

Here resolving dependencies is quite tricky, webpack follows a different algorithm (which includes aliases and stuffs)
to resolve dependencies. For the sake of simplicity, we can follow the node js module import resolving alogrithm by using
`path.join` and joining the dirname of it's parent module and the current module.

```js
function resolveRequest(requester, requestedPath) {
  return path.join(path.dirname(requester), requestedPath);
}
```

If app.js is passed as an input, then the following module graph will be created.

```js
ModuleGraph {
  path: './test/app.js',
  content: 'import add from "./add.js";\n' +
    'import diff from "./diff.js";\n' +
    '\n' +
    'console.log(add(1, 2));\n' +
    'console.log(diff(2, 1));\n',
  ast: Node {
    type: 'File',
    start: 0,
    end: 108,
    loc: SourceLocation {
      start: [Position],
      end: [Position],
      filename: undefined,
      identifierName: undefined
    },
    errors: [],
    program: Node {
      type: 'Program',
      start: 0,
      end: 108,
      loc: [SourceLocation],
      sourceType: 'module',
      interpreter: null,
      body: [Array],
      directives: []
    },
    comments: []
  },
  dependencies: [
    ModuleGraph {
      path: 'test/add.js',
      content: 'const add = (a, b) => {\n  return a + b;\n};\n\nexport default add;\n',
      ast: [Node],
      dependencies: []
    },
    ModuleGraph {
      path: 'test/diff.js',
      content: 'const diff = (a, b) => {\n  return a - b;\n};\n\nexport default diff;\n',
      ast: [Node],
      dependencies: []
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Bundling

After creating the module graph, the next step is to create a bundled js code. Since it is a graph, I have written a small
snippet to traverse the graph and store modules' content in the order it should be bundled (i.e dependencies of a module should
come before the actual module - Depth First Search - Rollup way of bundling)

```js
function build(graph) {
  let modules = dfs(graph);
}

function dfs(graph) {
  const modules = [];
  collect(graph, modules);
  return modules;

  function collect(module, modules) {
    modules.push(module);
    module.dependencies.forEach((dependency) => collect(dependency, modules));
  }
}
```

Now since we have collected the modules in the order it should be bundled we can concatenate the contents, but we would
still have the import statements. So we can use babel's transformFromAstSync method and try to remove the import-export
statement.

```js
function bundle(graph) {
  let modules = collectModules(graph);
  let code = "";
  for (var i = modules.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    let module = modules[i];
    const t = babel.transformFromAstSync(module.ast, module.content, {
      ast: true,
      plugins: [
        function () {
          return {
            visitor: {
              ImportDeclaration(path) {
                path.remove();
              },
              ExportDefaultDeclaration(path) {
                path.remove();
              },
            },
          };
        },
      ],
    });
    code += `${t.code}\n`;
  }
  return code;
}
```

:::tip
Here we are removing the export statement of the input module as well which is not ideal, so we can mark the input module
and not remove export declaration for that module alone.
:::

### 3. Writing in the target location

Finally we can write the bundled code in the target location, using `fs.writeFileSync`, but `writeFileSync` will only
write if the directory of the output is also present (i.e if output location is 'dist/index.js', it will write only if
dist folder is present). So I have a copied a small snippet from stack overflow to write a file by creating a directory,
if not present,

```js
function writeFileSyncRecursive(filename, content, charset) {
  const folders = filename.split(path.sep).slice(0, -1);
  if (folders.length) {
    // create folder path if it doesn't exist
    folders.reduce((last, folder) => {
      const folderPath = last ? last + path.sep + folder : folder;
      if (!fs.existsSync(folderPath)) {
        fs.mkdirSync(folderPath);
      }
      return folderPath;
    });
  }
  fs.writeFileSync(filename, content, charset);
}
```

Now passing the input as `app.js` and output as `dist/index.js` to builder function, you will get the following bundled
code,

```js
const diff = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};

const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(add(1, 2));
console.log(diff(2, 1));
```

Thus we have written our own module bundler by following the rollup way. We can also support a few extra options
like code minification and mangling by using [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser), we can also support `iife`
format by wrapping the bundle with an iife expression. Since this is a basic example on how a bundler works, I have
skimmed through a few stuffs, but in practice module bundlers are quite complex and interesting to learn about.
