I published this website back in May 2020, My website has gone through a lot of changes. Initially I was using Heroku for deployments, later I found out
about Netlify and migrated my deployments to it. Since I was using this repo for testing out new stuffs,
I have used a lot of react frameworks, css frameworks, and component libraries here.
This website has went through a lot of iteration and right now I am happy with my current tech stack. I am currently using,

- React
- Next JS
- Tailwind
- <a

  target="\_blank"

  > Ak Palette
  > </a> (My Component library)
- Netlify
