Developers have different code writing styles, so when it comes to collabrations
people face a lot of problems in understanding other developers code. So we have
to ensure a common coding style and start enforcing people to write in that style.

<br />
<br />
This can be achieved by eslint which is linter on which various rules can be
added that people can follow to have a common style throught their code base.
But as your project grows certain pre-defined rules might not be sufficient for
your project so you might want to add your own rules or plugins into eslint. In
this blog I am going to explain how to write your own eslint plugin.

## Required Packages

- yo (Yeomon)
- generator-eslint

```shell
npm i -g yo generator-eslint
```

## Plugin Creation

To Create a plugin run the following command

```shell
mkdir eslint-plugin-ak
cd eslint-plugin-ak

yo eslint:plugin

? What is your name? ...
? What is the plugin ID? tutorial
? Type a short description of this plugin: ...
? Does this plugin contain custom ESLint rules? Yes
? Does this plugin contain one or more processors? No

npm install
```

## Rule Creation

We are going to write a rule to avoid importing a package, which has a better replacement.

Let say you have been using underscore js but want to enforce people on using loadash. So lets create a rule 'no-underscore'

```shell
yo eslint:rule

? What is your name? ...
? Where will this rule be published? ESLint Plugin
? What is the rule ID? no-underscore
? Type a short description of this rule: ...
? Type a short example of the code that will fail:import _ from 'underscore'
```

Run `npm i` to install all the remaining packages that comes with generator-eslint

## Abstract Syntax Tree

The next thing that we are going to see is AST which is a tree structure of the javascript code that we wrote.We get an AST by parsing the code we wrote into a parsers such as babylon,espree etc,. Eslint uses espree parser, Thus using this AST we can get info about the source code that we wrote.

<br />
Below is an AST for the following code, `import _ from 'underscore' `

```json
{
  "type": "Program",
  "start": 0,
  "end": 26,
  "range": [0, 26],
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "ImportDeclaration",
      "start": 0,
      "end": 26,
      "range": [0, 26],
      "specifiers": [
        {
          "type": "ImportDefaultSpecifier",
          "start": 7,
          "end": 8,
          "range": [7, 8],
          "local": {
            "type": "Identifier",
            "start": 7,
            "end": 8,
            "range": [7, 8],
            "name": "_"
          }
        }
      ],
      "source": {
        "type": "Literal",
        "start": 14,
        "end": 26,
        "range": [14, 26],
        "value": "underscore",
        "raw": "'underscore'"
      }
    }
  ],
  "sourceType": "module"
}
```

As you can see we get the complete info about a code in a json format which we can tap into to write our rule.
As you can see from the ast, we want to check whether the literals value is 'underscore' provided its parent object is an 'ImportDeclaration'

So write the following a code in your no-underscore.js file in lib/rules

```js
module.exports = {
  meta: {
    docs: {
      description: "Avoiding the use of underscore package in repo",
      category: "Fill me in",
      recommended: false,
    },
    fixable: null,
  },

  create: function (context) {
    return {
      Literal: function (node) {
        const isUnderscore =
          node.value === "underscore" &&
          node.parent.type === "ImportDeclaration";
        if (isUnderscore) {
          context.report({
            node,
            message: "Underscore package use is prohibited use Loadash instead",
          });
        }
      },
    };
  },
};
```

Now run `npm run test` in your terminal which runs our valid and invalid test cases

## Wrapping Up

As ESLint does not enable any rules by default, we will probably want to export a config that enables our new rule. Sp replace with the following code in our index.js file in lib folder

```js
module.exports = {
  rules: {
    "no-underscore": require("./rules/no-underscore"),
  },
  configs: {
    base: {
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 2020,
        sourceType: "module",
      },
      env: {
        browser: true,
        es6: true,
      },
      plugins: ["ak"],
      rules: {
        "ak/no-underscore": 2,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

As you can see we have a plugin called ak with a rule no-underscore.
Do `npm publish` to publish your package
To use this rule in your repo provided you added eslint to your project, run `npm i eslint-plugin-ak`
Now add your plugin as an extension in your .eslintrc.js file (if you are using js config)

```js
extend: ["plugin:ak/base"];
```

and add the following rule,

```js
rules:{

'no-underscore':2

}
```

By doing so you might starting seeing warnings for using underscore package in your repo. Check out the plugin's source code [here](https://github.com/akshay9677/eslint-plugin-ak)
