Have you ever wondered how web apps like figma or google earth were able to scale inspite of their complexity ?
Building such a complex app only with javascript is not optimal. This is where web assembly
comes into play. So what is web assembly ? and how it is used in the browsers ? Web-assembly is
a machine language which is now accepted by browsers, they have less compilation time and run in near native speed.
Does this mean javascript will be replaced ? Well no, Web assembly was created with a motive to work along side javascript,
which means we can write a web assembly code and import it into javascript file with appropriate loaders.

## Overview of Web assembly

If you had a micro processor or micro controller course in engineering like me, then you must
have learned to code for microprocessors like 8086, 8086, etc, where you will have to allocate
memory for variables and do the necessary computations, well web - assembly is that but for the
browsers. Even-though Web-assembly is a language itself, it was created to act as a link between
other languages like C, C++, Rust etc. Therefore, now programmers from different coding language background
can write codes for browsers.
Therefore you can use web assembly when something requires complex computation in the web, or if you want to run other
languages code in the browser. Webassmebly can be written in different languages and they have respective
compilers to convert them to web assembly. Thus it can be used to build web-based
games, video & audio manipulation in the web, etc. This opens a window of oppurtunity for new complex web apps which can run
faster and smoother in the browser. Check out the [list of applications](https://madewithwebassembly.com/all-projects)
that were built using web assembly.

Also as I said earlier Web assembly is not here to replace javascript, it is developed to co-exist with javascript.
it is designed in such a way that javascript is required for starting and initializing it, we'll look into, how to use Web assembly in javascript in the later part of the
blog. A good example for this is figma, which has a outer ui made of react and the inner design tool is written in C++ and compiled
to Web assembly code.

#### Why Web assembly is faster ?

Javascript is a compiled language which means the code you write is parsed, compiled and optimised before you get an executable code or before the browser engine
runs your code, but in case of Web Assembly, being a machine language it is just decoded and compiled, no need of extra compilation time,
and that is why it is faster.

<div
  style={{
    display: "flex",
    width: "100%",
    justifyContent: "center",
    padding: "30px 0px",
  }}
>
  <img src={Webassembly} />
</div>

> There are various libraries out there to convert different languages to web assembly, for example to convert C++ to Web assembly there is Emscripten, also there is
> Asterius, a Haskell to WebAssembly compiler, one such library is assembly script.

### Assembly Script

Assembly script accepts a typescirpt like syntax which is compiled to Webassmebly code. This means that you can write
a typescript code, which gets converted to Webassmebly code which you can import it and use that in
your js files.

Lets take a look on how to write a assembly script code. As I said earlier everything
needs to be allocated some memory, similarly in case of assembly script we allocate memory like defining a type in typescript. Thus it is a javascript code with web assembly types. For example,

```ts
function add(a: i32, b: i32): i32 {
  return a + b;
}
```

As you can see the two arguments are a 32 bit integer type and the
function returns a 32 bit integer, which means that few types are quite different from actual typescript code. To know about assembly
script types, check out [this](https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html#webassembly-types) link.

There a lot of quirks and conditions in writing code in assembly script, for instance you can't create
objects directly like `var a = {}`, this is not permitted, instead this should be done,

```ts
var a = new Map<string, string>();
a.set("sayhello", "hello, world");
```

Also assembly script does not allow union types, which means a value should have only one type.

```ts
function add(a: i32 | string): void {}
```

The above code is not a valid syntax in assembly script. Check out [assembly script docs](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) to get a better
understanding on how to write assembly script code.

### Getting Started

```shell
npm install @assemblyscript/loader
npm install -D assemblyscript
npx asinit
```

There are the two packages required for compiling your assembly script code, Install those loader and compiler and then create a new assembly
script project using `npx asinit`. This adds the starter files for writing your web assembly project. To compile the assembly script code to web assembly code run
`npm run asbuild`

Now an optimised wasm file will be produced which can be imported in your js files and can be used right away.
Lets take a look on how to use a web assembly code in javascript.

Lets assume that you have a web assembly code called example.wasm (yes web assembly codes have .wasm extension and
the equivalent text format has a .wat extension) which is compiled from assembly script, you can use that in a js file as such

```js
const compiledwasm = new WebAssembly.Module(
  fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "./example.wasm")
);
const instance = new WebAssembly.Instance(compiledwasm);
module.exports = instance.exports;
```

The WebAssembly.Module() constructor creates a new module object containing WebAssembly code that
has been already compiled. The WebAssembly.Instance() constructor creates an executable instance form the
module object from WebAssembly.Module()

Therefore by using assembly script we were able to write typescript like code and compile it to a web assembly module and
then used it in a js file.
